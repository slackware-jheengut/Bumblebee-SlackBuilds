PACKAGE NAME:     xf86-video-nouveau-blacklist-noarch-1
PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
xf86-video-nouveau BLACKLIST FILE

This is NOT the experimental nouveau driver for nVidia cards.

It is a stub that installs /etc/modprobe.d/nouveau-blacklist.conf,
so that nouveau dri module shipped with our kernel will not load and
prevent the nv driver and/or the binary nVidia driver from working.

If you have obtained the nouveau driver yourself and want to try it,
remove this package to allow the kernel module to load.
